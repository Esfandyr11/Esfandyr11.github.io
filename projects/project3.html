        <h1>Text-SQL System: Optimizing Data for Vector Search</h1>

        <div class="box" id="introduction">
            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hey there! Today, I want to talk about how we can optimize our data for better vector search. We're dealing with a massive scale here—10 PostgreSQL databases, each with 10-12 tables, and each table having 300-450 columns. That's a lot of data!</p>
            <p>We'll go through setting up metadata dictionaries, passing embeddings to a vector database (FAISS) with HNSW indexing and flat product quantization, querying for the most similar columns, and pushing this into the information space of a language model (LLM) with the prompt and metadata embedding.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box" id="scale">
            <h2>2. The Scale of the Data</h2>
            <p>So, let's break down the scale of the data we're dealing with. We have 10 PostgreSQL databases, and each database has around 10-12 tables. Each of these tables has a whopping 300-450 columns. That's a lot of columns to keep track of!</p>
            <p>To give you an idea, if we have 10 databases, each with 12 tables, and each table with 450 columns, we're looking at:</p>
            <p class="equation">
                \[ \text{Total Columns} = 10 \times 12 \times 450 = 54,000 \text{ columns} \]
            </p>
            <p>That's a lot of data to manage and search through efficiently.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box" id="metadata">
            <h2>3. Setting Up Metadata Dictionaries</h2>
            <p>To make sense of all this data, we need to set up metadata dictionaries. These dictionaries will contain information about column names, table names, original names, data types, query examples, and row data examples.</p>
            <p>Here's an example of what a metadata dictionary might look like:</p>
            <pre><code>
{
  "table_name": "sales_data",
  "columns": [
    {
      "column_name": "product_id",
      "original_name": "product_id",
      "data_type": "integer",
      "query_example": "SELECT product_id FROM sales_data WHERE product_id = 123;",
      "row_data_example": 123
    },
    {
      "column_name": "product_name",
      "original_name": "product_name",
      "data_type": "text",
      "query_example": "SELECT product_name FROM sales_data WHERE product_name LIKE '%chair%';",
      "row_data_example": "Ergonomic Office Chair"
    },
    // More columns...
  ]
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>This structure helps us keep track of all the important details about our data.</p>
        </div>

       <div class="box" id="vector-database">
    <h2>4. Passing Embeddings to Vector Database (FAISS)</h2>
    <p>
        Next, we need to pass these embeddings to a vector database. We'll use FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) with HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) indexing and flat product quantization.
    </p>
    <p>
        FAISS is a popular library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It provides various algorithms for both exact and approximate nearest neighbor searches, making it highly scalable and flexible.
    </p>
    
    <h3>HNSW Indexing</h3>
    <p>
        HNSW is a graph-based algorithm that allows for efficient similarity search in high-dimensional spaces. The algorithm works by constructing a multi-layered graph, where each node represents a data point, and edges connect similar nodes. This hierarchical structure allows for fast nearest neighbor searches by navigating through different layers of the graph.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mathematically, the HNSW algorithm can be represented as:
    </p>
    <p class="equation">
        \[ \text{HNSW}(G, q) = \arg\min_{v \in G} d(q, v) \]
    </p>
    <p>
        Where \( G \) is the graph, \( q \) is the query vector, and \( d \) is the distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance).
    </p>
    <p>
        The process of building the HNSW graph can be understood as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Initialization:</strong> Start by creating the first layer of the graph with all data points. Each node in this layer is connected to a certain number of nearest neighbors.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer Creation:</strong> Additional layers are created by selecting a subset of nodes from the previous layer. These layers become progressively sparser.</li>
        <li><strong>Graph Navigation:</strong> During the search, the algorithm starts from the topmost layer and navigates downwards, moving from one node to its nearest neighbors until the closest nodes in the lowest layer are found.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        This hierarchical approach significantly reduces the search complexity and ensures a balance between accuracy and speed. For a more detailed understanding, you can refer to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.09320">HNSW paper</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Flat Product Quantization</h3>
    <p>
        Flat product quantization is a dimensionality reduction technique that reduces the storage and computation requirements while preserving the similarity information of the vectors. This technique decomposes the original high-dimensional vector space into a product of lower-dimensional subspaces, which are quantized independently.
    </p>
    <p>
        The decomposition can be mathematically represented as:
    </p>
    <p class="equation">
        \[ V = V_1 \times V_2 \times \ldots \times V_k \]
    </p>
    <p>
        Where \( V \) is the original vector space, and \( V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_k \) are the lower-dimensional subspaces.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each subspace \( V_i \) is quantized separately, and the product quantization (PQ) process can be illustrated as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Partitioning:</strong> The original vector space \( V \) is partitioned into \( k \) subspaces, each of which is lower-dimensional.</li>
        <li><strong>Quantization:</strong> Each subspace \( V_i \) is quantized independently. The quantization can be achieved by selecting a set of centroids (codebook) that best represent the data points within each subspace.</li>
        <li><strong>Encoding:</strong> Each vector in the original space is represented as a concatenation of the indices of the nearest centroids in each subspace. This process results in a compressed representation of the vectors.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The goal of product quantization is to minimize the quantization error, which is the difference between the original vector and its quantized representation. This process is crucial in scenarios where large-scale vector data needs to be stored and queried efficiently.
    </p>

    <h3>Quantization Rate by Product Quantizers</h3>
    <p>
        The optimal product quantizer can be found by solving the integral bit allocation problem:
    </p>
    <p class="equation">
        \[ \min \left\{ \|W - \hat{W}(N_1, \dots, N_m, \text{prod})\|^2, N_1, \dots, N_m \geq 1, N_1 \times \dots \times N_m \leq N, m \geq 1 \right\} \]
    </p>
    <p>
        Expanding this, we get:
    </p>
    <p class="equation">
        \[ \|W - \hat{W}(N_1, \dots, N_m, \text{prod})\|^2_2 = \sum_{n \geq 1} \lambda_n \|\hat{\xi}_n^{N_n} - \xi_n\|^2_2 \]
    </p>
    <p>
        This further simplifies to:
    </p>
    <p class="equation">
        \[ \sum_{n=1}^m \lambda_n \left( e^{N_n^2(N(0;1), \mathbb{R})} - 1 \right) + T^2_2 \]
    </p>
    <p>
        Given that:
    </p>
    <p class="equation">
        \sum_{n \geq 1} \lambda_n = E \sum_{n \geq 1} \left(W | e_n W\right)^2_2 = E \int_0^T W_t^2 dt = \int_0^T t dt = T^2_2.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to Theorem 6.3 (as referenced in Luschgy and Pagès [2002]), for every \( N \geq 1 \), there exists an optimal scalar product quantizer of size at most \( N \) (or at level \( N \)), denoted by \( \hat{W}(N, \text{prod}) \), of the Brownian motion defined as the solution to the minimization problem. These optimal product quantizers form a rate-optimal sequence, such that:
    </p>
    <p class="equation">
        \|W - \hat{W}(N, \text{prod})\|_2 \leq c_W T (\log N)^{1/2}.
    </p>
    <p>
        A sketch of the proof shows that by assuming \( T = 1 \) without loss of generality and combining the expansion with Zador's theorem, we get:
    </p>
    <p class="equation">
        \|W - \hat{W}(N_1, \dots, N_m, \text{prod})\|^2_2 \leq C \left( \sum_{n=1}^m \frac{1}{n^2 N_n^2} \right) + \sum_{n \geq m+1} \lambda_n \leq C' \left( \sum_{n=1}^m \frac{1}{n^2 N_n^2} + \frac{1}{m} \right),
    </p>
    <p>
        where \( \Pi_n N_n \leq N \). Setting \( m := m(N) = \lceil \log N \rceil \) and \( N_k = \lceil (m! N)^{1/m}/k \rceil \geq 1, \) for \( k = 1, \dots, m \), gives the upper bound as described.

            <h2>5. Querying the Vector Database</h2>
            <p>Once we have our embeddings in the vector database, we can query it for the top N most semantically and contextually similar columns. This is where the magic happens!</p>
            <p>We can use a similarity metric like cosine similarity to find the most similar columns. The cosine similarity between two vectors A and B is calculated as:</p>
            <p class="equation">
                \[ \text{similarity} = \cos(\theta) = \frac{A \cdot B}{\|A\| \|B\|} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n A_i B_i}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n A_i^2} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n B_i^2}} \]
            </p>
            <p>The cosine distance is then defined as \(1 - \text{similarity}\).</p>
            <p>Another important metric is the Euclidean distance, which is calculated as:</p>
            <p class="equation">
                \[ d(A, B) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (A_i - B_i)^2} \]
            </p>
            <p>For high-dimensional spaces, the Manhattan distance can also be useful:</p>
            <p class="equation">
                \[ d(A, B) = \sum_{i=1}^n |A_i - B_i| \]
            </p>
            <p>These distance metrics help us find the most similar columns in the vector space.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box" id="llm">
            <h2>6. Pushing into the LLM Information Space</h2>
            <p>Finally, we push this information into the information space of a language model (LLM) with the prompt and the metadata embedding. This allows the LLM to understand the context and semantics of the data better.</p>
            <p>The LLM can then use this information to generate more accurate and relevant queries. For example, if we ask the LLM to find all products related to "office chairs," it can use the metadata and embeddings to find the most relevant columns and generate a query like:</p>
            <pre><code>
SELECT product_name, price FROM sales_data WHERE product_name LIKE '%office chair%';
            </code></pre>
            <p>The process of embedding the metadata can be represented as:</p>
            <p class="equation">
                \[ E = \text{Embedding}(M) \]
            </p>
            <p>Where \( E \) is the embedding vector, and \( M \) is the metadata dictionary. The embedding function can be a neural network or any other suitable model.</p>
            <p>The LLM then uses this embedding to generate the query:</p>
            <p class="equation">
                \[ Q = \text{LLM}(E, P) \]
            </p>
            <p>Where \( Q \) is the generated query, \( E \) is the embedding vector, and \( P \) is the prompt.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box" id="conclusion">
            <h2>7. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>And that's it! By setting up metadata dictionaries, passing embeddings to a vector database, querying for the most similar columns, and pushing this information into the LLM, we can optimize our data for better vector search.</p>
            <p>This approach allows us to handle large-scale data efficiently and generate more accurate and relevant queries. It's a win-win!</p>
